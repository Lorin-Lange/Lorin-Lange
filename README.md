I'm a software developer who uses mostly Haskell, C++, Kotlin, Java and C.
For Android and Spring Boot development I use Kotlin and Java. Also, I know the basics of relational database systems like PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB and MySQL such as SQL and 
database normalization.
I like Prolog and I'd like to learn more about it.
I know the basics of Linux and Bash, too. I use it on servers (Debian, Ubuntu) and on my desktop (Fedora).
