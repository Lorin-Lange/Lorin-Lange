I'm a software developer who uses mostly Haskell, C++, Kotlin, Java and C.
For Android and Spring Boot development I use Kotlin and Java. I know the basics of relational database systems including SQL, too.
I'd like to learn more about Prolog.
I know the basics of Linux and Bash. I use it on servers (Debian, Ubuntu) and on my desktop (Fedora).
