I'm a software developer who uses mostly Haskell, C++, Kotlin, Java and C.
For Android and Spring Boot development I use Kotlin and Java. Also, I know the basics of relational database systems such as SQL, like PostgreSQL, SQLite, MariaDB and MySQL.
I like and I'd like to learn more about Prolog.
I know the basics of Linux and Bash, too. I use it on servers (Debian, Ubuntu) and on my desktop (Fedora).
